<h2><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p>Every anthologist must adopt some plan for making selections. Mine has
been very simple. I have made a small collection of poems that would
have pleased the child I used to be and the boy who was my playmate.
Above all things I have striven to keep the book small, for the big
books of poetry on our shelves were always left to themselves. It was
the little books that became our intimate companions.</p>

<p>To make a selection for boys and girls from the countless riches of
lyric poetry in our language, and to reduce that selection to the
contents of so small a book as this one, is a grave task. It involves
the exclusion on the grounds of mere lack of space, of so much that one
loves. I should have liked to make a book of this size containing only
Elizabethan songs and early English ballads, another entirely devoted to
Georgian and Victorian poets, a third to living writers, and a fourth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>child-rhymes, parodies, nonsense verses and the like. If the grown-up
reader regrets omissions, I beg him to be sympathetic toward the
compiler, who has been a prey to those same regrets constantly during
the year in which she has been at work on the book. Alas that a volume
cannot have the advantages of being both a big book and a little one at
the same time!</p>

<p>In selecting the poems for the girl and boy who used to be, I have tried
always to read with their eyes. I have been guided from first to last by
their enjoyment or their boredom. The poems that they loved best had
highly accented rhythms, and took them into “a land of clear colors and
stories.” They enjoyed certain sad poems as much as merry ones, but
meditative, moralistic and gloomy poems were never read but once, if
they were read at all. And I am glad to say that poems full of
sentimentality fared no better. I have brought together much that has
been written since they were children, and boys and girls of to-day will
find among these poems many of the most enjoyable things in the book. To
mention only one recent poet that they would have loved, Walter de la
Mare, is to realize how much a child has missed who does not possess his
inimitable “Peacock Pie.”</p>

<p>A child’s enjoyment, as I said above, is what I have striven for in this
collection. We who have seen how poetry has come to our rescue with its
delight, its healing, and its new courage in times of stress and sorrow,
know that it is an inestimable possession. We cannot come to the
knowledge of it too early. If we can have a clear personal realization
while we are children, that we love poetry, no amount of well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>meaning
but sometimes tactless and uninspired teaching of it in schools and
colleges can shake us in the knowledge of that love. I remember that the
first poem I was condemned to learn by heart in school was “The
Builders” by Longfellow. I say condemned, but it was not as a
punishment. Every child in the class had to learn it. It is one of the
poems that I am sure the poet himself would never have given to a child
to learn, beginning, as grown-up readers will remember:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“All are Architects of Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Working in these walls of Time.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">After committing the nine stanzas of this poem to memory, it took me a
long time to grow willing to read the stirring things that the same poet
has written, poems as interesting as this one is humdrum.</p>

<p>But education is better managed now than then. Teachers and parents
alike have come to feel that the love of poetry in general is more to be
desired for children than the knowledge of certain “well known” poems,
no matter how good, or even how great, these poems may be. Besides a
more tactfully managed education in the schools, there are children’s
rooms in the public libraries. I have wished many times during the
months spent in making this book, when visits to these rooms were an
inspiration, that I might have browsed among the low shelves long ago in
childhood, and talked with the same delightful librarians. I should like
to express my thanks to these librarians, who have been so kind in
various<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> ways. I want especially to thank Annie Carroll Moore,
Supervisor of Work with Children in the New York Public Library, who
knows the heart of a child from long travelling on “The Roads to
Childhood.”</p>

<p>In closing I shall quote briefly from the introduction by Andrew Lang to
his anthology for children, “The Blue Poetry Book,” for he speaks my own
thoughts better than I can express them: “It does not appear to the
Editor that poems about children, or especially intended for children,
are those which a child likes best. A child’s imaginative life is spent
in the unknown future, and in the romantic past.... The poems written
for and about children rather appeal to the old, whose own childhood is
now to them a distant fairy world, as the man’s life is to the child....
We make a mistake when we ‘write down’ to children; still more do we err
when we tell a child not to read this or that because he cannot
understand it. He understands far more than we give him credit for, but
nothing that can harm him. The half-understanding of it, too, the sense
of a margin beyond, as in a wood full of unknown glades and birds and
flowers unfamiliar, is a great part of a child’s pleasure in reading....
The child does not want everything to be explained. In the unexplained
is great pleasure.”</p>

<p>A number of my friends have been kind in giving me the names of poems
that they liked best when they were children. The small compass of the
book has made it impossible to use all of the poems suggested in this
way, but it has been a pleasure to include as many of them as I could. I
want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span> acknowledge very gratefully my indebtedness for counsel and
suggestions to John Gould Fletcher, Vachel Lindsay, Amy Lowell, Jessie
B. Rittenhouse, Louis Untermeyer, Jean Untermeyer, John Hall Wheelock
and Marguerite Wilkinson.</p>

<span class="i0">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through caverns measureless to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to a sunless sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So twice five miles of fertile ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With walls and towers were girdled round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where blossom’d many an incense-bearing tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It flung up momently the sacred river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then reach’d the caverns measureless to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From the fountain and the caves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a miracle of rare device,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A damsel with a dulcimer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a vision once I saw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was an Abyssinian maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her dulcimer she played,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing of Mount Abora.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her symphony and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such a deep delight ’twould win me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with music loud and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would build that dome in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sunny dome! Those caves of ice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who heard should see them there<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if they were changed into blocks of wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to move a step, or cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the children merrily skipping by,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could only follow with the eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That joyous crowd at the Piper’s back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how the Mayor was on the rack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wretched Council’s bosoms beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Piper turned from the High Street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Weser rolled its waters<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, he turned from south to west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Great was the joy in every breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“He never can cross that mighty top!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’s forced to let the piping drop,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A wondrous portal opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when all were in, to the very last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The door in the mountain-side shut fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I say, all? No! One was lame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not dance the whole of the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sadness, he was used to say,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“It’s dull in our town since my playmates left!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can’t forget that I am bereft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the pleasant sights they see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the Piper also promised me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joining the town and just at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where waters gushed, and fruit-trees grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything was strange and new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their dogs outran our fallow deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honey-bees had lost their stings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horses were born with eagles’ wings;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as I became assured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lame foot would be speedily cured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The music stopped and I stood still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found myself outside the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left alone against my will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go now limping as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never hear of that country more!”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O, young Lochinvar is come out of the West!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode all unarm’d, and he rode all alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He stay’d not for brake and he stopp’d not for stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride had consented, the gallant came late;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So boldly he enter’d the Netherby Hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘O, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘I long woo’d your daughter, my suit you denied;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I am come with this lost Love of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The bride kiss’d the goblet: the knight took it up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He quaff’d off the wine and he threw down the cup.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She look’d down to blush, and she look’d up to sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Now tread we a measure!’ said young Lochinvar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stately his form and so lovely her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never a hall such a galliard did grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bride-maidens whispered, ‘<span class="lftspc">’</span>Twere better by far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have match’d our fair cousin with young Lochinvar!’<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they reach’d the hall door, and the charger stood near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So light to the saddle before her he sprung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,’ quoth young Lochinvar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was racing and chasing, on Cannobie lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.<br /></span>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
